##Contributions

Help us build this plugin. We will be paying in BTC regularly to this repo. This will be divided among al contributors. See: https://mobbr.com/#/task/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL21vYmJyL21vYmJyLWJyb3dzZXItcGx1Z2lu

Check the milestones and issues for required functionality and open tasks.

In short: we need the plugin to open the Mobbr lightbox. To see this lightbox, click the button here: http://ask.mobbr.com/187/where-is-the-add-payment-button

The browser button should be not much more (or less) than 'an-out-of-page' Mobbr-button. With the advantage of course that we can add Mobbr support from the outside. Ideally the button shows amounts like the real button.
